# 3DTestGround
My 3D Platformer I am using to test various skills in 3D.

# Current Working On
Moving Platforms and Wall Running.

The big issue right now is that the character controller I am using for our player doesn't account for physics objects in the way I need it to. To counteract this, I am going to rebuild the character movement script using rigidbody movement instead. This should also stop the strange character stretching glitch.
